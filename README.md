# story-json-to-amp

Compile [story-json](https://github.com/micnews/story-json) documents into [AMP stories](https://github.com/ampproject/amphtml/blob/master/extensions/amp-story/amp-story.md).

Not all features of the `story-json` format are supported at the moment. Open an issue if you need something that isn't supported yet. PRs are always welcome!

## Usage

```js
import story from './story.json';
import storyJsonToAmp from 'story-json-to-amp';

const ampHtml = storyJsonToAmp(story);
```

## API

In addition to [standard `story-json` properties](https://github.com/micnews/story-json#document-properties), a few special optional properties can be added to the document:

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ------------- |
| `customCss` | Extra CSS to append to AMP story document. This is useful for adding fonts or making AMP-specific customizations. |
| `analytics` | Array of [AMP analytics objects](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/reference/components/amp-analytics) |
| `bookendConfigSrc` | [Bookend endpoint URL](https://www.ampproject.org/docs/tutorials/visual_story/create_bookend) |
